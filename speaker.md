This document holds the outline of the speaking script that accompanies the reader text in [main.html](https://github.com/rrrutledge/innersource-intro/blob/master/main.html) ([PDF view](https://github.com/rrrutledge/innersource-intro/files/1924845/InnerSource-Intro.pdf)).
It's structure follows the reader text.
For each section there is an annotation describing who is its speaker.
It is assumed that the speaker will explain the section content in their own words.
Notes here in this document describe any intentional deviation from the content of the reader text in the form of additional detail, stories, or items that the speaker should highlight and share.

## Introduction (Danese & Russ)
* Each person introduces themselves.
* Danese introduces the overall concept of inner source.
* Russ introduces the content of the training video.

## A Common Scenario (Russ)

### Wait it out (Russ)
* Story of a team wanting us to upgrade a library that was easier for them to support.
The ticket is still open.

### Work around (Russ)
* We had to work around the QMA performing a case-sensitive check on incoming HTTP headers.

### Escalate (Danese)

* We chose cheeses to designate executives to whom guests escalate then a feature request isn’t being implemented fast enough. In our experience, it’s really common for executive escalations to devolve
* Huge time and resource sink
* Not much is learned in the process of writing the feature / fixing the bug
* Much friction is added to the system

## Solution Overview (Danese)

## Solution Detail - up to 1st paragraph - definitions (Danese)

* Explanation we usually give about how house rules help you know how to behave and what to expect as a guest
* Hosts expect you’ll take your shoes off inside or that you won’t let the cat out, etc.
* Guests expect clean and perhaps private space

## Solution Detail (Russ)

Really point out that the host team remains in control via specificying up-front any constraints on the completeed work.

## Benefits (Danese/Russ)
* How to split up this section between us?
* (Danese) Key teams that were able to reduce interrupt-driven work by 60%, which gave them back their capacity to plan and execute
* (Russ) Segue on the scalability point by sharing the story of 5 teams building AWS EC2 deployment at once together.
* (Russ) Our small team of 3 engineers ran a continuous delivery pipeline that grew to be used by (nearly) 200 projects monthly.
* (Russ) The work of the team organically shifted to AWS Lambda deployment because that's where people wanted to contribute
* (Russ) After engineers learned how to talk to each other a natural way they started working together on other things - e.g. node-api-blueprint.

## Principles (Danese)

* This concept (mentorship) comes straight out of the Apache Way.
Trusted Committers are team members who not only understand the codebase well enough to coach someone else in writing good pull requests to achieve a desired outcome, but they also have the knack of passing on that wisdom in a constructive way.
In Open Source it is an honor to get voted to Trusted Committership.

## Conclusion (Russ & Danese)
* Russ summarizes the content of the training.
* Danese invites those watching to join the InnerSource Commons.
